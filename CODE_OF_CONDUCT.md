# Code of Conduct
## Introduction
We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of background, and we welcome contributions from everyone. Our community operates on principles of respect, empathy, selfless love (ἀγάπη or agápē), and mutual support. We encourage constructive engagement and focus on the well-being of the project and its members.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- **Using welcoming and inclusive language**
- **Showing empathy and kindness towards others**
- **Engaging in the Principle of Charity**: Interpreting others' statements in the most positive light possible
  - _Note_: Learn more about the Principle of Charity [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity). 
- **Giving and receiving constructive criticism gracefully** 
  - _Good Example_: "I appreciate your work on this feature. I noticed a potential issue with scalability and suggest we explore optimization strategies."
  - _Good Response_: "Thank you for the feedback. I'll look into the suggestions and see how they can improve the feature."
- **Focusing on the well-being of the community and the success of the project**
  - _Good Example_: Prioritizing tasks that benefit the project as a whole, even if they are not personally rewarding.

Examples of **_unacceptable_** behavior by participants include:

- **Using sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances**
- **Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks**
- **Public or private harassment**
- **Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission**
- **Engaging in unconstructive criticism**
  - _Bad Example_: "This code is terrible. You clearly don't know what you're doing."
- **Responding defensively to constructive criticism** 
  - _Bad Example_: "Well, if you think it's so bad, why don't you fix it yourself?"

## Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [friend.to.net.web.devs@gmail.com](mailto:friend.to.net.web.devs@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
